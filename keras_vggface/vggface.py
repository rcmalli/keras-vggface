    """Instantiates the VGGFace architectures.
    Optionally loads weights pre-trained
    on VGGFace datasets. Note that when using TensorFlow,
    for best performance you should set
    `image_data_format="channels_last"` in your Keras config
    at ~/.keras/keras.json.
    The model and the weights are compatible with both
    TensorFlow and Theano. The data format
    convention used by the model is the one
    specified in your Keras config file.
    # Arguments
        include_top: whether to include the 3 fully-connected
            layers at the top of the network.
        weights: one of `None` (random initialization)
            or "vggface" (pre-training on VGGFACE datasets).
        input_tensor: optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`)
            to use as image input for the model.
        model: selects the one of the available architectures 
            vgg16, resnet50 or senet50 default is vgg16.
        input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified
            if `include_top` is False (otherwise the input shape
            has to be `(224, 224, 3)` (with `channels_last` data format)
            or `(3, 224, 244)` (with `channels_first` data format).
            It should have exactly 3 inputs channels,
            and width and height should be no smaller than 48.
            E.g. `(200, 200, 3)` would be one valid value.
        pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction
            when `include_top` is `False`.
            - `None` means that the output of the model will be
                the 4D tensor output of the
                last convolutional layer.
            - `avg` means that global average pooling
                will be applied to the output of the
                last convolutional layer, and thus
                the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
            - `max` means that global max pooling will
                be applied.
        classes: optional number of classes to classify images
            into, only to be specified if `include_top` is True, and
            if no `weights` argument is specified.
    # Returns
        A Keras model instance.
    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid argument for `weights`,
            or invalid input shape.
